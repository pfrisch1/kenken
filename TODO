* Write code to generate random games
    * add randomly within constraints
    * one by one, pick clues and starting points
    * division first, plus minus multiplication, equals last
* Figure out how to encode games for storage
? Write code to determine if solution is unique
? Scrape for more games

* Do division first
* then do first pass
* then merge excessive equals into new or adjacent clues
